          As a physicist, I develop mathematical models and utilize computer simulations to study material properties for nanoelectronic applications. In addition to computational work on materials, I have also used optical interferometric microscopy to characterize the surface topography of solar cells and optical flats. Finally, I am proud to highlight my solid foundation in data analytics, using data science, machine learning, and optimization techniques throughout my academic career.
